# Fantasy Football GUI
A GUI that assists users in making fantasy football decisions by comparing statistics, advising on draft choices, evaluating trade proposals, and more. (Yes, I should have used a folder to store the modules.) This is another project I did for fun, as I wanted to learn how to create a GUI (graphical user interface).

## Additional capabilities of the GUI include:
- Includes a tutorial on how to use it
- Creates plots of players' stats over the years to directly compare them with one another
- Allows the user to conduct mock drafts and grades their picks
- When a player is clicked, it generates a pop up window showing all his stats, bio, and combine information
- Generates a pop up showing all the stats for the user's favorite team
- Contains roster information spanning multiple years
- etc.
